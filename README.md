<h1 align="center">Yesterday</h1>
### A BBEdit color scheme designed not to suck.

As you may have already noticed, "Yesterday" is a play on words of the name of an already very popular family of color schemes called [Tomorrow](https://github.com/chriskempson/tomorrow-theme) by Chris Kempson, I've always liked that colorscheme but found some it's ports and design decisions not up to my taste, hence the creation of Yesterday for BBEdit, the finest editor on the Macintosh!

I haven't yet considered porting this to other editors/apps yet (especially since it isn't awfully original) but may think about it at a later date.
